Hello, my name is Szymon. Here is my version of MEMORY GAME. 
I do my best for this 4 days and I am always proud of projects like this - its simple to work, hard to do (hopefully for now).
I am trying to code everyday, learning on own mistakes and being happy when my little program working. I want to change my carrier path
and i want to be a C#/.NET programmer. If it is possible I am waiting for priceless feedback what I can do better.
Thank you for your time. Hope to see You soon.

Bye!
